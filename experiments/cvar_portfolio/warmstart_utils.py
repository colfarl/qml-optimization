def relax_problem(problem):
    """
    Converts a binary QuadraticProgram into a continuous relaxation.

    This function transforms all binary decision variables into continuous variables
    bounded between 0 and 1. This is useful for generating a relaxed version of 
    the original combinatorial optimization problem, which can then be solved using
    classical convex solvers. The resulting solution can serve as a warm start 
    (soft guidance) for quantum optimization algorithms like QAOA.

    Args:
        problem (QuadraticProgram): The binary (combinatorial) optimization problem.

    Returns:
        QuadraticProgram: A relaxed version of the input problem with continuous variables.

    - A custom mixer Hamiltonian circuit that ensures the initial state is a ground state.
